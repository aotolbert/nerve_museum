            <p>Tom Patterson was born and grew up in Dublin, Georgia, and graduated in 1974 from St. Andrews College in Laurinburg, North Carolina. After working as a reporter for a couple of small-town newspapers in the mid-1970s, Patterson settled in Atlanta and soon developed a reputation as a hard-working magazine journalist with special interests in both nature and culture. He spent time as a staff writer for the now-legendary Southern travel magazine Brown’s Guide to Georgia from 1978 until 1982. He has written freelance articles and reviews for Atlanta Magazine, Atlanta-based Art Papers and the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Patterson also served as director and publisher of Pynyon Press, a non-profit publisher of small-edition literary and graphic-art books.</p>

        <p>Patterson started writing about contemporary art and artists around 1980. In the early 1980s he began focusing particular attention on “outsider art” in the South, first in several magazine articles, and later in books and exhibitions that he organized as an independent curator. In 1985 he moved from Atlanta to Winston-Salem to work with Jonathan Williams on the Jargon Society’s Southern Visionary Folk Art Project, a three-year effort to document examples of this non-academic art in several southern states. His first curatorial project, a 20-artist show titled “Southern Visionary Folk Artists” (co-curated with Roger Manley) opened in early 1985 and broke new ground in introducing this type of work to contemporary art audiences. Patterson has gone on to curate a number of exhibitions at museums and art galleries across the United States.</p>

        <p style="line-height: 2em;"><span class="largeQuotes">"</span>Patterson’s roles as critic and curator are interwoven. “In both cases I’m essentially involved with the same concerns–art and the way it’s presented in museums and galleries. When writing as a critic, I’m an evaluator of art that I didn’t select and curatorial decisions I didn’t make. As a curator I’m an enthusiastic advocate for work that I’ve selected–art that has already passed my test, so to speak–and I write about what I see as its strengths and virtues.” Patterson doesn’t have one method of curation. Artists, themes, or materials may serve as the starting point for his exhibits. Much like his childhood experiences, Patterson’s professional life allows him to acknowledge all of the art that surrounds us, but still champion the pieces that speak to him in some special way.<span class="largeQuotes">"</span></p>
